		<a id="installation"></a>Installation
	</h2>

	<p>
		Opt4J currently requires Java 21.
		To compile the following examples, you will need the respective JDK installed.
		Opt4J is distributed as single .zip file that can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/sdarg/opt4j/releases">here</a>.
		After extracting the files, the folder structure looks like this:
	</p>
	<ul class="iconlist">
		<li class="folder">opt4j-3.4.0</li>
		<li><ul class="iconlist">
			<li class="folder">bin</li>
			<li><ul class="iconlist">
				<li class="linux">opt4j</li>
				<li class="bat">opt4j.bat</li>
				<li class="xml">test.config.xml</li>
				<li class="python">batch.py</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li class="folder">lib</li>
			<li class="folder">licenses</li>
			<li class="folder">plugins</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The application is launched with opt4j.bat under Windows and
		opt4j under Linux/Unix/OSX, respectively. Once started, it will appear
		the module configurator that allows to select an optimizer and problem
		as well as setting their parameters. For testing, load the
		test.config.xml and start the optimization with 'run'.</p>
	<p>To develop custom optimization problems and algorithms for
		Opt4J, the files in the lib folder have to be on the classpath for
		compiling and starting the code. To start the module configurator
		manually, one has to run the class <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/start/Opt4J.html">Opt4J</a> which
		contains a corresponding main method.</p>
	<p>To execute a specific configuration without the indirection over
		the user interface, you need to pass a configuration file to the
		application with the additional -s parameter to start the
		optimization. You may try this by executing the following command
		inside the bin folder:</p>
	<pre class="console">&gt; ./opt4j -s test.config.xml</pre>
	<p>If you write custom optimization problems and algorithms, you
		can drop a jar-file with the compiled code into the plugins folder and
		the corresponding modules are found automatically once Opt4J starts.</p>

	<p class="tip">Use the batch.py script with python 2.x to run batch
		experiments for predefined configuration xml files. Execute 'python
		batch.py' to get further instructions how to use the script.</p>

	<h2>
		<a id="problems"></a>Defining Optimization Problems
	</h2>

	<p>Custom optimization problems are typically defined by providing
		three main classes:
		(1) The <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/problem/Creator.html">Creator</a>,
		(2) the <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/problem/Decoder.html">Decoder</a>, and
		(3) the <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/problem/Evaluator.html">Evaluator</a>.
		The functionality of these classes is illustrated in the following figure:
		<img src="img/problem.png" alt="Creator &rarr; Genotype &rarr; Decoder &rarr; Phenotype &rarr; Evaluator &rarr; Objectives"/></p>
	<p>The creator provides random genotypes. A genotype is the genetic
		representation of an individual. The decoder transforms the genotype
		into the phenotype which represents all observable characteristics and
		components of the individual. Finally, based on the phenotype, the
		evaluator determines the objectives that represent the quality of the
		current individual.</p>

	<p>By defining the creator, decoder, and evaluator (and implicitly
		the genotype and phenotype), the optimization algorithm can tackle the
		problem. In the following, it is shown how this can be done for two
		simple problems.</p>

	<h3>Example: Hello World</h3>
	<p>
		The hello world problem is inspired by the <a
			href="http://watchmaker.uncommons.org/">Watchmaker Framework</a>
		tutorial. The goal is to optimize a string of eleven characters until
		this string results in the optimal solution "HELLO WORLD". For this
		purpose, we need to define the corresponding creator, decoder, and
		evaluator.
	</p>
	<p>In the first step, we define the creator that implicitly defines
		the genotype:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class HelloWorldCreator implements Creator&lt;SelectGenotype&lt;Character&gt;&gt; {
	protected Character[] ALPHABET = { 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P',
			'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z', ' ' };
	protected Random random = new Random();
	@Override
	public SelectGenotype&lt;Character&gt; create() {
		SelectGenotype&lt;Character&gt; genotype = new SelectGenotype&lt;&gt;(ALPHABET);
		genotype.init(random, 11);
		return genotype;
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>As mentioned, the task of the creator is to generate random
		genotype objects. In our case, we want to generate random strings with
		eleven characters. Here, we choose one of the predefined genotype
		classes that allows to select from a given alphabet and initialize it
		randomly with eleven (11) characters.</p>
	<p class="tip">Note that Opt4J contains a set of predefined
		genotype classes (in the <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/genotype/package-summary.html">genotype</a> package) that can
		also be combined and one should always choose from this set if
		possible instead of implementing custom genotypes that require an
		implementation of custom operators.</p>

	<p>In the second step, we define the decoder that implicitly
		defines the phenotype:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class HelloWorldDecoder implements Decoder&lt;SelectGenotype&lt;Character&gt;, String&gt; {
	public String decode(SelectGenotype&lt;Character&gt; genotype) {
		String phenotype = "";
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; genotype.size(); i++) {
			phenotype += genotype.getValue(i);
		}
		return phenotype;
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The task of the decoder is to convert our genotype into a
		phenotype which in our case is a string. This is done straightforward
		by copying the characters into a string.</p>

	<p>In the third step, we define the evaluator:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class HelloWorldEvaluator implements Evaluator&lt;String&gt; {
	@Override
	public Objectives evaluate(String phenotype) {
		int value = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; phenotype.length(); i++) {
			value += (phenotype.charAt(i) == "HELLO WORLD".charAt(i)) ? 1 : 0;
		}
		Objectives objectives = new Objectives();
		objectives.add("objective", Sign.MAX, value);
		return objectives;
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The task of the evaluator is to determine the quality of one
		phenotype, i.e., one string. In our case, we count the number of
		matching characters when it is compared to "HELLO WORLD". Here, we
		want the number to be maximized. Note that we can add multiple
		objectives such that the problem becomes a multi-objective
		optimization problem.</p>

	<p>Finally, we define a problem module:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class HelloWorldModule extends ProblemModule {
	protected void config() {
		bindProblem(HelloWorldCreator.class, HelloWorldDecoder.class, HelloWorldEvaluator.class);
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The problem module defines the problem and here particularly the
		corresponding creator, decoder, and evaluator. Once the module
		configurator is started, this problem module is automatically detected
		if it is on the classpath and we can select it. </p>
	<p class="tip">You can also add additional evaluators and, thus,
		implicitly additional objectives by passing the additional evaluator
		class to the <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/problem/ProblemModule.html#addEvaluator(java.lang.Class)">addEvaluator(..)</a> method inside the config method.</p>

	<h3>Example: Traveling Salesman</h3>

	<p>
		The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling
			salesman problem</a> is a classic optimization problem. The goal is to
		minimize the length of a path that is required to visit a set of
		cities. The following code examples show a little bit of the
		dependency injection capabilities that are integrated into Opt4J by
		using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google
			Guice</a>. It might be therefore also a good idea to have a short look at
		the tutorial of Guice if one plans to use dependency injection
		extensively. For this example, a profound understanding of Guice will
		not be necessary.
	</p>

	<p>Let us start by defining our problem instance:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class SalesmanProblem {
	protected Set&lt;City&gt; cities = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
	public class City {
		protected final double x;
		protected final double y;
		public City(double x, double y) {
			this.x = x;
			this.y = y;
		}
		public double getX() {
			return x;
		}
		public double getY() {
			return y;
		}
	}
	@Inject
	public SalesmanProblem(@Constant(value = "size") int size) {
		Random random = new Random(0);
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
			final double x = random.nextDouble() * 100;
			final double y = random.nextDouble() * 100;
			final City city = new City(x, y);
			cities.add(city);
		}
	}
	public Set&lt;City&gt; getCities() {
		return cities;
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>First we define that a city is given by an x and a y coordinate.
		In the constructor of our problem, we randomly generate a certain
		amount of cities that can later on be obtained. Here, the constructor
		is annotated with @Inject that is used by Guice to indicate which
		constructor will be used when the instance is created. The size
		argument in the constructor is annotated as constant that will be
		later set in the problem module.</p>

	<p>The phenotype looks as follows:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class SalesmanRoute extends ArrayList&lt;City&gt; {
}
</pre>
	<p>In this case, we define a custom phenotype that is represented
		as a list of cities.</p>

	<p>Now its again time to define our creator, decoder, and
		evaluator. Lets start with the creator:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class SalesmanCreator implements Creator&lt;PermutationGenotype&lt;City&gt;&gt; {
	protected final SalesmanProblem problem;
	@Inject
	public SalesmanCreator(SalesmanProblem problem) {
		this.problem = problem;
	}
	@Override
	public PermutationGenotype&lt;City&gt; create() {
		PermutationGenotype&lt;City&gt; genotype = new PermutationGenotype&lt;&gt;();
		for (City city : problem.getCities()) {
			genotype.add(city);
		}
		Collections.shuffle(genotype);
		return genotype;
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The creator receives the problem instance in the constructor and
		saves it into a member variable. Here, we again see the @Inject
		annotation that is a little Guice magic to wire everything together.
		For the genotype, we use a predefined permutation genotype and add all
		cities. The permutation defines the order in which the cities will be
		visited by the traveling salesman. Note that each genotype is randomly
		shuffled before it is returned which is important since each genotype
		has initially to be generated completely randomly.</p>

	<p>In the next step, we define the decoder:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class SalesmanDecoder implements Decoder&lt;PermutationGenotype&lt;City&gt;, SalesmanRoute&gt; {
	public SalesmanRoute decode(PermutationGenotype&lt;City&gt; genotype) {
		SalesmanRoute salesmanRoute = new SalesmanRoute();
		for (City city : genotype) {
			salesmanRoute.add(city);
		}
		return salesmanRoute;
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>Here, we simply take the genotype and copy the cities in its
		current order into a route. Note that for more complex problems, a
		decoder can often do much more than just transforming the
		representation such as repairing, etc. Moreover, the decoder allows to
		implement different genotype representations of the same problem while
		the evaluator does not have to be changed at all since the decoder can
		transform each genetic representation into the same phenotype.</p>

	<p>The evaluator looks as follows:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class SalesmanEvaluator implements Evaluator&lt;SalesmanRoute&gt; {
	public Objectives evaluate(SalesmanRoute salesmanRoute) {
		double dist = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; salesmanRoute.size(); i++) {
			City one = salesmanRoute.get(i);
			City two = salesmanRoute.get((i + 1) % salesmanRoute.size());
			dist += getEuclideanDistance(one, two);
		}
		Objectives objectives = new Objectives();
		objectives.add("distance", Sign.MIN, dist);
		return objectives;
	}
	private double getEuclideanDistance(City one, City two) {
		final double x = one.getX() - two.getX();
		final double y = one.getY() - two.getY();
		return Math.sqrt(x * x + y * y);
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The evaluator calculates the length of the current route and
		returns it as an objective that has to be minimized.</p>

	<p>Finally we define the module as follows:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class SalesmanModule extends ProblemModule {
	@Constant(value = "size")
	protected int size = 100;
	public int getSize() {
		return size;
	}
	public void setSize(int size) {
		this.size = size;
	}
	public void config() {
		bindProblem(SalesmanCreator.class, SalesmanDecoder.class, SalesmanEvaluator.class);
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>Additionally to setting the creator, decoder, and evaluator, we
		add a property size and annotate it as constant, corresponding to the
		argument in the constructor of the problem instance. Note that a
		correct property in the modules always requires a getter and setter
		method. If we start the configurator now, we will see that
		additionally to adding the problem module, we can also now set the
		size of our problem. The wiring of the problem, i.e., setting the size
		of the problem instance and passing the problem instance to the
		creator is now done by Guice and we do not have to burden ourselves
		with that.</p>

	<h2>
		<a id="algorithms"></a>Defining Optimization Algorithms
	</h2>

	<p>Optimization in Opt4J follows a strict iterative pattern. All
		optimization algorithms have an initialization and an iterative
		optimization (next). Within these methods, the population of
		individuals has to be improved while the archive is updated in the
		background. As discussed before, each individual consists of a
		genotype, phenotype, and its objectives.</p>

	<p>Opt4J already integrates many tools that are required to
		assemble optimization algorithms. The main ones are the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Factories that allow to construct new individuals either
			randomly or with a given genotype.</li>
		<li>Operators that allow to generate new genotypes from existing
			ones by mutation, crossover, algebraic operations, and so on.</li>
		<li>Selectors that allow to determine the worst (and parent)
			solutions of a population based on the objectives which is
			particularly important for multi-objective problems.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you want to write custom optimizers, the following example
		will give you an idea how this is possible in Opt4J. On the other
		hand, it might be also worth to have a look into the source code and
		learn from reading the code of the existing algorithms.</p>

	<h3>Example: Mutate Optimizer</h3>

	<p>This example shows how to write a very simple optimizer that is
		based on mutation only. The presented optimizer has a fixed population size
		of 100 and creates 25 offspring individuals from 25 parent individuals
		each generation by a mutate operation. The optimizer is implemented as
		follows:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class MutateOptimizer implements IterativeOptimizer {
	protected final IndividualFactory individualFactory;
	protected final Mutate&lt;Genotype&gt; mutate;
	protected final Copy&lt;Genotype&gt; copy;
	protected final Selector selector;
	private final Population population;
	public static final int POPSIZE = 100;
	public static final int OFFSIZE = 25;
	@Inject
	public MutateOptimizer(Population population, IndividualFactory individualFactory,
			Selector selector, Mutate&lt;Genotype&gt; mutate, Copy&lt;Genotype&gt; copy) {
		this.individualFactory = individualFactory;
		this.mutate = mutate;
		this.copy = copy;
		this.selector = selector;
		this.population = population;
	}
	public void initialize() throws TerminationException {
		selector.init(OFFSIZE + POPSIZE);
	}
	public void next() throws TerminationException {
		if (population.isEmpty()) {
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; POPSIZE; i++) {
				population.add(individualFactory.create());
			}
		} else {
			if (population.size() &gt; POPSIZE) {
				Collection&lt;Individual&gt; lames = selector.getLames(population.size() - POPSIZE,
						population);
				population.removeAll(lames);
			}
			Collection&lt;Individual&gt; parents = selector.getParents(OFFSIZE, population);
			for (Individual parent : parents) {
				Genotype genotype = copy.copy(parent.getGenotype());
				mutate.mutate(genotype, 0.1);
				Individual child = individualFactory.create(genotype);
				population.add(child);
			}
		}
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The initialization ensures that the selector is initialized. The optimization 
		process is implemented in the next method. In the first iteration, the population 
		is still empty and 100 new individuals are created and added. 
		In all following iterations, first, the population is reduced to 100 by 
		removing the worst individuals that are identified by the selector. Then, 25
		parent individuals are determined by the selector and for each of
		these individuals, one individual is created by copying the genotype
		and mutating it. Finally, the new individuals are added to the
		population.</p>

	<p>The optimization module looks as follows:</p>
	<pre class="prettyprint">public class MutateOptimizerModule extends OptimizerModule {
	@MaxIterations
	protected int iterations = 1000;
	public int getIterations() {
		return iterations;
	}
	public void setIterations(int iterations) {
		this.iterations = iterations;
	}
	@Override
	public void config() {
		bindIterativeOptimizer(MutateOptimizer.class);
	}
}
</pre>
	<p>The module requires to set the maximal number of iterations for
		the iterative optimizer by adding a property with the annotation
		@MaxIterations.</p>

	<h2>
		<a id="integration"></a>Integration
	</h2>
	<p>Opt4J is designed as a framework. However, it might also be
		comfortably used as a library in other projects. To embed Opt4J in
		other applications, the modules can be configured in Java, i.e.,
		without the usage of the configurator. The following code snippet
		shows how to optimize the first DTLZ test function with an
		evolutionary algorithm from Java and, finally, how to obtain the best
		found solutions:</p>

	<pre class="prettyprint">EvolutionaryAlgorithmModule ea = new EvolutionaryAlgorithmModule();
ea.setGenerations(500);
ea.setAlpha(100);
DTLZModule dtlz = new DTLZModule();
dtlz.setFunction(DTLZModule.Function.DTLZ1);
ViewerModule viewer = new ViewerModule();
viewer.setCloseOnStop(true);
Opt4JTask task = new Opt4JTask(false);
task.init(ea,dtlz,viewer);
try {
        task.execute();
        Archive archive = task.getInstance(Archive.class);
        for (Individual individual : archive) {
                // obtain the phenotype and objective, etc. of each individual
        }
} catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
        task.close();
} </pre>
	<p>First, you will have to construct the desired modules for the
		optimization process. An optimization process requires at
		least a
		<a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/problem/ProblemModule.html">ProblemModule</a>
		which defines the Creator, Decoder, and Evaluator as described in
		<a href="#problems">Section 2</a>. Here, the
		<a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/benchmarks/dtlz/DTLZModule.html">DTLZModule</a>
		is used as an example. Also, an
		<a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/optimizer/OptimizerModule.html">OptimizerModule</a>
		is required which defines the optimization algorithm to use for the problem. In the	example, the
		<a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/optimizers/ea/EvolutionaryAlgorithmModule.html">EvolutionaryAlgorithmModule</a> is chosen but also the MutateOptimizerModule as developed in <a href="#algorithms">Section 3</a> could be used here. Additionally, the optional
		<a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/viewer/ViewerModule.html">ViewerModule</a>
		is created, which provides the GUI for the optimization process.</p>
	<p>The
		<a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/start/Opt4JTask.html">Opt4JTask</a>
		takes these modules and controls the optimization process.
		Here, it is constructed with the parameter <code>false</code> that
		indicates that the task is closed manually and not
		automatically once the optimization stops. The Opt4JTask is
		initialized with the modules. Now, it is possible to execute the task
		(which is blocking in this case, but you can also start it in a
		separate thread) and once the optimization is finished, you can obtain
		the <a class="jdoc" href="../../javadoc/3.4.0/org/opt4j/core/optimizer/Archive.html">Archive</a> to iterate over the best solutions. After closing the
		task, obtaining instances like the Archive is not possible anymore.</p>
